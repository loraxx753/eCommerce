		<span>Shipping Policy</span>
		<p>You are guaranteed to receive your furniture in good condition without exception UNLESS its damaged and you sign for it as good. If your furniture is damaged in shipping you MUST list any damage on the trucking company receipt called proof of delivery. You have a right and a responsibility to inspect.</p>

		<span>Showroom Pickup</span>
		<p>You will receive a call when your order has arrived at our warehouse. You can then pick-up your order at our warehouse during our normal business hours (7 days a week). You may call us ahead of time to ask for dimensions of the boxes/item(s) to insure they will fit in your car/truck. If you need to place your items on a roof rack or in a pick-up bed please bring the necessary rope/tie-down cords with you. We will help place the items on your roof rack or pick-up bed but our staff is NOT allowed to assist you in tying the items down.</p>

		<span>Delivery and Set-Up</span>
		<p>You will receive a call when your order is complete and a delivery appointment will be scheduled 24-48 hours in advance. The delivery crew will then bring your new items into your home, open the boxes/item(s), perform any and all assembly needed and place them in your room of choice. If you choose, they will also remove the boxes/garbage that arrived as packaging for you order. Please insure that the room where you want your new furniture assembled is cleared of any old furniture. Our delivery personnel are not responsible for moving existing furniture out of any given room.</p>

		<span>Return Policy</span>
		<p>We will accept merchandise returns of items at our stores within 90 days of customer receipt. Please understand, however, that bedding items may be returned or exchanged only if in their original packaging.</p>

		<p>Depending on the nature of the return/exchange and the presence of an original receipt or packing slip, we will issue an appropriate credit or refund in one of the following ways:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>If accompanied by the Original Sales Receipt or Packing Slip, the item’s purchase price will be refunded in the Original Form of Tender.</li>
			<li>If accompanied by an Original Gift Receipt, the item’s purchase price will be refunded via a Shop Card.</li>
			<li>If an Original Sales or Gift Receipt is not present, the item’s current retail price will be refunded via a Shop Card, regardless of amount. Valid photo ID is required for store returns without an Original Sales or Gift Receipt.</li>
			<li>For store returns of cash purchases accompanied by the Original Sales Receipt, a cash refund will be given up to $100. If the purchase exceeds $100, a check in the amount of the balance of the refund will be mailed to the customer.</li>
		</ul>
